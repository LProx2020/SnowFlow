# <img src="img/logo.jpg"  width="50"> SnowFlow

_Goal:_ We hope to couple the ECSimpleSnow snow depth and density model with the OverlandFlow model to model snow melt runoff (discharge at outflow of water).

Advanced Ideas:
- Assess Flood Risk (risk factor?)
- Add additional precipitation
- Switch to HexModelGrid for better overland flow?
